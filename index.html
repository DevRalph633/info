                        Growing up, I was always considered a bit of an oddball, and honestly, I never really made an effort to hide it. I embraced it in my own way, but things started to shift when I entered junior high. It was around that time when people began openly calling me "weird," and it wasn't just a quiet remark here and there—it was loud and clear, and no one seemed embarrassed to say it. That constant attention made me feel self-conscious and, honestly, quite depressed during that period. However, everything took a turn for the better once I reached senior high school. That's when I met friends who truly understood me and with whom I could connect on a deeper level. Those two years became the best of my life, and I look back on them with fondness. Now, here I am in college, working hard to complete my degree and pursue my future goals.

                        As you may already know, I am a digital artist, and I'd like to share some of my artwork with you. I know that some of them might not look very polished or refined, but to me, they hold value because they represent something I truly enjoy doing. Even if others might not see them as masterpieces, creating art is a hobby that brings me happiness, and that's what matters most to me. It’s something that allows me to express myself and find joy in the process, regardless of how they might turn out.

                        I really enjoy playing games, especially RPGs and adventure games. There's something about immersing myself in a story and exploring new worlds that I find exciting. I also have a soft spot for a bit of horror mixed in, as the thrill adds a fun challenge to the experience. On top of that, I surprisingly find myself drawn to farming games. It's hard to pinpoint exactly why, but there's something oddly relaxing and rewarding about managing a farm, planting crops, and seeing everything grow. I guess I just enjoy the calming and methodical nature of it, even though it might seem a bit unconventional compared to other genres I play.

                    <p>
                        Ever since I was a kid, I've always had a fascination with wildlife documentaries. I’m not entirely sure why I was drawn to them from the very beginning, but I do remember that my parents were always supportive of me watching them. Maybe it was because I just loved learning about nature and the intricate ways in which animals live and interact with their environment. There’s something about seeing the behavior of every creature and understanding how they adapt and survive in the wild that I find incredibly captivating. It's always been an interest of mine, and I guess it just grew naturally over time.

                        I absolutely love listening to music, and honestly, I can't imagine what I'd do without it. Whenever I'm feeling sad, stressed, or frustrated, music has this amazing ability to help me calm down and put my mind at ease. It’s like a soothing escape for me. Whether it's a song that makes me feel understood or just one that lifts my mood, I always find comfort in it. Every song I come across, if I find it enjoyable, becomes a way for me to release tension and regain my sense of balance. Music, in a way, has become a constant companion that helps me navigate through difficult moments.
